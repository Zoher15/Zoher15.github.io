We’ve collected opinions from 11 participants on 15 different chocolates. Below, you’ll find a series of colorful box plots, each one exploring a different tasty trend. Let’s break it down:</p> <h2 id="1-overall-chocolate-ratings-">1. <strong>Overall Chocolate Ratings</strong> 🍫</h2> <p>Our first box plot gives a bird’s-eye view of <strong>all 15 chocolates</strong> rated by our participants. From creamy milk chocolates to bold extra dark ones, the ratings tell a tale of chocolate dreams and, well, a few nightmares too!</p> <p><strong>Box Plot Explanation</strong>: This box plot lines up chocolates from least to most liked, with the duds on the left and fan favorites on the right. The wider the box, the more divided the opinions—some folks thought it was a delight, while others weren’t impressed. As you browse the plot, you’ll see a range of tastes: some chocolates were adored, while others… well, they weren’t everyone’s cup of cocoa. Expect a few surprises—some hidden gems and shockingly low scores along the way! 🍫🎉</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b2a2181-c84c-47c2-9be5-ef1420a34ad7" alt="image" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"></p> <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The ratings for our 15 chocolates were as mixed as a bowl of chocolate chips! Some chocolates hit the sweet spot (literally), while others crumbled under the pressure. Our tasters didn’t hold back with their critiques—<em>looking at you, super dark chocolates!</em> But a few stood out from the crowd, emerging as clear fan favorites:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Tony’s Chocolonely Dark Almond (40-50%)</strong></li> <li><strong>Tony’s Chocolonely Milk (30%)</strong></li> <li><strong>Mr. Beast’s Feastables Dark Chocolate (40-50%)</strong></li> </ol> <p>Interestingly, all three winners are part of Tony’s Open Chain for Cocoa! Looks like ethical sourcing and great taste go hand-in-hand. 🍫👏</p> <h2 id="2-milk-chocolates-30-cocoa-ratings-">2. <strong>Milk Chocolates (30% Cocoa) Ratings</strong> 🥛🍫</h2> <p>Now let’s zoom in on the <strong>milk chocolates</strong>—those with 30% cocoa content, to be exact! These are typically the smooth, sweet favorites. But were they a crowd-pleaser this time?</p> <p><strong>Chocolates Analyzed</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Lindt (30%)</li> <li>Cafe Decker (30%)</li> <li>Lily’s Creamy Milk (30%)</li> <li>Chocolove (30%)</li> <li>Tony’s Chocolonely (30%)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Box Plot Explanation</strong>: This box plot focuses exclusively on milk chocolates, once again sorted by their median rating—least liked on the left, most liked on the right. Do these creamy classics live up to their smooth and sweet reputation, or did some tasters find them a little too meh? The width of each box shows how much people agreed (or disagreed)—the wider it is, the more mixed the opinions. Will these chocolates melt hearts or leave some wanting a richer bite? Let’s dive in and find out! 🍫✨</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00d3185-719f-4018-ad70-28dae588f50d" alt="image" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"></p> <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Milk chocolates are usually the crowd-pleasers, and it looks like they mostly lived up to the hype. While favorites like Chocolove and Tony’s Chocolonely scored consistently high, a few other milk chocolates didn’t hit the mark for everyone. It seems even among milk chocolate fans, there are some tough critics out there! 🧐 But one chocolate stole the show:</p> <p>🥇 The crown for the best milk chocolate goes to Tony’s Chocolonely Milk (30%)! 🎉</p> <p>Smooth, sweet, and worthy of every bite! 🍫👑</p> <h2 id="3-dark-chocolates-40-50-cocoa-ratings-">3. <strong>Dark Chocolates (40-50% Cocoa) Ratings</strong> 🍫✨</h2> <p>For our third plot, we move to the world of <strong>dark chocolates</strong> with cocoa content between 40% and 50%. These chocolates strike a balance between sweet and bitter, appealing to a wide audience—or so we think!</p> <p><strong>Chocolates Analyzed</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Tony’s Chocolonely (40-50%)</li> <li>Ghirardelli (40-50%)</li> <li>Endangered Species (40-50%)</li> <li>Fresh Thyme (40-50%)</li> <li>Mr. Beast (40-50%)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Box Plot Explanation</strong>: This box plot focuses exclusively on dark chocolates, sorted by their median rating—least liked on the left and most liked on the right. The question is: did these semi-dark delights strike the perfect balance, or did they leave some tasters craving a touch more sweetness… or perhaps even more bitterness? Either way, expect a few surprises—because when it comes to dark chocolate, not every bite is everyone’s cup of cocoa! 🍫😋</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b23cf9-489d-494f-bdda-ec6a45a48162" alt="image" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"></p> <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> These dark chocolates tread the fine line between sweet and bitter, sparking a wide range of opinions. Brands like Tony’s Chocolonely (40-50%) and Mr Beast seem to have won over more hearts, but some others didn’t quite charm the crowd—perhaps they weren’t “dark” enough for the hardcore dark chocolate enthusiasts? 🧐 And, once again, the crown for the best dark chocolate goes to… Tony’s Chocolonely! 🎉 Looks like they’ve mastered the art of balancing boldness and sweetness! 🍫👑</p> <h2 id="4-extra-dark-chocolates-70-and-above-ratings-">4. <strong>Extra Dark Chocolates (70% and above) Ratings</strong> 🌑🍫</h2> <p>Now it’s time for the <strong>extra dark chocolates</strong>, the true heroes (or villains) of the tasting session. These intense chocolates aren’t for the faint-hearted!</p> <p><strong>Chocolates Analyzed</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Tony’s Chocolonely (70%)</li> <li>Beyond Good (70%)</li> <li>Equal Exchange (92%)</li> <li>Lindt (70%)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Box Plot Explanation</strong>: This box plot features extra dark chocolates sorted by their median rating, with the least liked on the left and the most liked on the right. These bold chocolates boast strong cocoa content—will they be adored for their richness or found too intense? Expect a mix of opinions, with some chocolates winning hearts and others… well, not everyone’s cup of cocoa! Get ready for a tasty journey through the highs and lows of dark chocolate love! 🍫✨</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a64e62f-d752-4497-8c16-ce6d0c99b30d" alt="image" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"></p> <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Let’s dive into the extra dark chocolates—where do we even begin? Bold and intense, these treats are nothing if not polarizing! Chocolates like Equal Exchange (92%) sent some tasters soaring into cocoa heaven, while others couldn’t give them a thumbs-down fast enough. This is the realm of serious chocolate aficionados, where there’s no middle ground—you either love it or you don’t. And the crown for the favorite?

This plot provides an epic showdown.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14b3557-ae0b-4098-b4d9-43c32346d5b8" alt="image" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"></p> <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It’s an all-out battle between milk, dark, and extra dark chocolates! And it looks like dark chocolates edged out milk chocolates, proving that sweetness is not enough to win over many hearts. As for the extra dark chocolates, let’s just say they’re more of an acquired taste. 😅</p> <h2 id="6-participant-ratings-">6. <strong>Participant Ratings</strong> 👥🍫</h2> <p>Finally, this box plot displays ratings from our chocolate lovers, sorted by median score.

Some are consistently generous, handing out high scores, while others aren’t shy about saying, “no thanks” to certain treats. It’s clear that everyone has their own unique definition of what makes a chocolate “delicious” or “disastrous.” Kaitlin loved the most chocolates, while Ege brought the most diverse opinions to the table! 🍫✨</p> <h2 id="grand-conclusion-of-the-cnets-chocolate-workshop-survey-"> <strong>Grand Conclusion of the CNetS Chocolate Workshop Survey</strong> 🍫</h2> <p>Our chocolate tasting survey revealed the diversity of chocolate preferences among participants, from the smoothness of milk chocolates to the boldness of extra dark varieties. <strong>Dark chocolates</strong> with 40-50% cocoa came out on top by striking a balance that appealed to most, while <strong>milk chocolates</strong> with their sweetness and smoothness also appealed to many. The <strong>extra dark chocolates</strong> (70% and above) drew more polarized opinions, with some appreciating the rich intensity and others finding it too bitter.</p> <p>One standout in the ratings was <strong>Tony’s Chocolonely</strong>, which consistently scored highly across different categories. But there’s more to Tony’s than great taste—the company is on a mission to <strong><a href="https://us.tonyschocolonely.com/pages/our-promise" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">eradicate child labor and modern slavery from the cocoa industry</a></strong>. Tony’s aims to bring attention to the inequalities in chocolate production, working towards 100% fair trade and urging other companies to adopt ethical practices.</p> <p>As consumers, it’s important to be mindful of the brands we support. When you choose a chocolate company like Tony’s Chocolonely, you’re not just buying a delicious treat—you’re also contributing to a movement for positive change in the chocolate industry.</p> <p>In the end, this survey reminds us that while our tastes in chocolate may vary, we can all agree that supporting ethical brands makes every bite a little sweeter. 🍫</p> <hr> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Zoher Kachwala. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2930004b8d7fcd0a8e00fdcfc8fc9f24"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?da39b660470d1ba6e6b8bf5f37070b6e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
