    "summary": "PhD candidate specializing in Natural Language Processing (LLMs), AI Alignment, and Reliable Machine Learning. My research centers on novel steering techniques to improve safety, controllability, and interpretability in LLMs/VLMs: Zero-shot detection of AI-generated images through task-aligned prompting of VLMs, supporting authenticity verification and content trust. Community-aware content moderation, using LLMs to interpret user history and apply nuanced, rule-grounded moderation at scale. Controlled reasoning in LLMs, analyzing decoding dynamics to guide generation toward faithful, safe, and interpretable outputs.",
