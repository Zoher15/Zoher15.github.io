## 1. **Overall Chocolate Ratings** 🍫

Our first box plot gives a bird’s-eye view of **all 15 chocolates** rated by our participants. From creamy milk chocolates to bold extra dark ones, the ratings tell a tale of chocolate dreams and, well, a few nightmares too!

**Box Plot Explanation**: This box plot lines up chocolates from least to most liked, with the duds on the left and fan favorites on the right. The wider the box, the more divided the opinions—some folks thought it was a delight, while others weren't impressed. As you browse the plot, you'll see a range of tastes: some chocolates were adored, while others... well, they weren’t everyone's cup of cocoa. Expect a few surprises—some hidden gems and shockingly low scores along the way! 🍫🎉

**Takeaway:** The ratings for our 15 chocolates were as mixed as a bowl of chocolate chips! Some chocolates hit the sweet spot (literally), while others crumbled under the pressure. Our tasters didn’t hold back with their critiques—*looking at you, super dark chocolates!* But a few stood out from the crowd, emerging as clear fan favorites:  

1. **Tony's Chocolonely Dark Almond (40-50%)**  
2. **Tony's Chocolonely Milk (30%)**  
3. **Mr. Beast's Feastables Dark Chocolate (40-50%)**  

Interestingly, all three winners are part of Tony’s Open Chain for Cocoa! Looks like ethical sourcing and great taste go hand-in-hand. 🍫👏

## 2. **Milk Chocolates (30% Cocoa) Ratings** 🥛🍫

Now let’s zoom in on the **milk chocolates**—those with 30% cocoa content, to be exact! These are typically the smooth, sweet favorites. But were they a crowd-pleaser this time?

**Chocolates Analyzed**: 
  - Lindt (30%)
  - Cafe Decker (30%)
  - Lily's Creamy Milk (30%)
  - Chocolove (30%)
  - Tony's Chocolonely (30%)
  
**Box Plot Explanation**: This box plot focuses exclusively on milk chocolates, once again sorted by their median rating—least liked on the left, most liked on the right. Do these creamy classics live up to their smooth and sweet reputation, or did some tasters find them a little too meh? The width of each box shows how much people agreed (or disagreed)—the wider it is, the more mixed the opinions. Will these chocolates melt hearts or leave some wanting a richer bite? Let’s dive in and find out! 🍫✨

**Takeaway:** Milk chocolates are usually the crowd-pleasers, and it looks like they mostly lived up to the hype. While favorites like Chocolove and Tony's Chocolonely scored consistently high, a few other milk chocolates didn’t hit the mark for everyone.

## **Grand Conclusion of the CNetS Chocolate Workshop Survey** 🍫

Our chocolate tasting survey revealed the diversity of chocolate preferences among participants, from the smoothness of milk chocolates to the boldness of extra dark varieties. **Dark chocolates** with 40-50% cocoa came out on top by striking a balance that appealed to most, while **milk chocolates** with their sweetness and smoothness also appealed to many. The **extra dark chocolates** (70% and above) drew more polarized opinions, with some appreciating the rich intensity and others finding it too bitter.

One standout in the ratings was **Tony’s Chocolonely**, which consistently scored highly across different categories. But there’s more to Tony’s than great taste—the company is on a mission to **[eradicate child labor and modern slavery from the cocoa industry](https://us.tonyschocolonely.com/pages/our-promise)**. Tony’s aims to bring attention to the inequalities in chocolate production, working towards 100% fair trade and urging other companies to adopt ethical practices.

As consumers, it’s important to be mindful of the brands we support. When you choose a chocolate company like Tony’s Chocolonely, you’re not just buying a delicious treat—you’re also contributing to a movement for positive change in the chocolate industry.

In the end, this survey reminds us that while our tastes in chocolate may vary, we can all agree that supporting ethical brands makes every bite a little sweeter. 🍫
