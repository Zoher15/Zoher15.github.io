I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/)'s [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), under the guidance of [Professor Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I am actively involved in the [Observatory on Social Media](https://osome.iu.edu/) and the [NaN research group](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan). I also have the privilege to collaborate with [Professor Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) and [Professor Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.io/).

I am passionate about bridging the gap between language understanding and structured knowledge. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of local knowledge graphs like Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) in trust-sensitive applications like fact-checking and question answering. My current research focuses on developing efficient graph-based methods to leverage and evaluate the semantic richness of AMRs.
