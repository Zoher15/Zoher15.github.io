I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/)'s [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), under the guidance of [Professor Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I am actively involved in the [Observatory on Social Media](https://osome.iu.edu/) and the [NaN research group](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan). I also have the privilege to collaborate with [Professor Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) and [Professor Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.io/).

My research focuses on enhancing LLM reasoning during inference, particularly at the token decoding stage. I aim to identify patterns that estimate a model’s confidence in its responses and develop methods to improve this confidence through guided decoding.

I approach this in two key ways. First, I explore diverse chains of thought and implement advanced voting/aggregation mechanisms that consider not only top-ranked answer tokens but also lower-ranked alternatives. Second, I enhance the model’s reasoning by incorporating soft signals, such as answer labels, to guide its chain of thought toward more accurate responses.
