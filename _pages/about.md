I am a PhD candidate at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/)'s [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), under the guidance of [Professor Filippo Menczer](https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil). I am actively involved in the [Observatory on Social Media](https://osome.iu.edu/) and the [NaN research group](https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan). I also have the privilege to collaborate with [Professor Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) and [Professor Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.io/).

My research focuses on advancing the capabilities of frontier **Large Language Models** to solve challenging real-world problems. I improve core model performance in practical applications like **semantic search and safe content generation** through:

- **Advanced LLM Decoding**: Designing and implementing novel decoding strategies to improve chain-of-thought reasoning, making models more robust, interpretable, and aligned with complex instructions.
- **Multimodal & Evaluation**: Developing prompt-based steering methods for VLMs to enhance performance on tasks like synthetic content detection, and creating robust evaluation pipelines.
- **Safe and Aligned AI**: Applying fine-tuning and prompt engineering to build policy-aware moderation systems that adhere to nuanced, subjective rules in online communities.

This work contributes to building more reliable, interpretable, and aligned AI systems.
