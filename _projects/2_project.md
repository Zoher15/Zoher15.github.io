## DARPA INCAS: Detecting Online Influence Campaigns

**Duration:** October 2021 â€“ May 2022  
**Institution:** Indiana University  
**Funding:** Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

### Project Overview

As part of the DARPA INCAS (Influence Campaign Awareness and Sensemaking) team, I contributed to developing advanced NLP and graph-based tools to detect and analyze online influence campaigns. This project focused on enhancing national security through improved understanding of information warfare and social media manipulation.

### Key Contributions

- **NLP Tool Development**: Created sophisticated natural language processing tools for analyzing social media content and detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior
- **Graph-Based Analysis**: Developed network analysis methods to identify patterns of influence and coordination across social media platforms
- **Security Applications**: Contributed to government-backed robustness and security efforts for protecting democratic processes
- **Multi-Platform Detection**: Built systems capable of analyzing influence campaigns across diverse social media ecosystems

### Technical Approach

The project employed cutting-edge techniques in computational social science and security:

1. **Content Analysis**: Advanced NLP for detecting coordinated messaging and narrative manipulation
2. **Network Analysis**: Graph-based methods for identifying coordinated account behavior
3. **Temporal Pattern Detection**: Time-series analysis for campaign lifecycle understanding
4. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Unified analysis across multiple social media platforms
5. **Real-Time Processing**: Scalable systems for continuous monitoring and detection

### Research Focus Areas

- **Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior**: Detection of bot networks and fake account coordination
- **Narrative Manipulation**: Analysis of how false information spreads and evolves
- **Platform Dynamics**: Understanding how influence campaigns adapt across different social media platforms
- **Attribution Methods**: Techniques for identifying the sources and motivations behind campaigns

### Impact and Applications

This research contributes to:
- **National Security**: Enhanced capabilities for detecting foreign interference
- **Election Security**: Tools for protecting democratic processes from manipulation
- **Platform Safety**: Methods for social media companies to detect coordinated inauthentic behavior
- **Academic Research**: Advancing the field of computational social science and security

### Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing**: State-of-the-art NLP models for content analysis
- **Graph Analytics**: Advanced network analysis tools and algorithms
- **Machine Learning**: Custom models for pattern detection and classification
- **Big Data Processing**: Scalable systems for analyzing large-scale social media data
- **Security Frameworks**: Specialized tools for cybersecurity and information warfare analysis
