The **Text2Graph** project involved designing and building a system to extract graph-based representations from unstructured text. The primary goal was to create a robust pipeline for generating structured knowledge that could be used for knowledge-grounded reasoning in Large Language Models.

This work has significant implications for improving information extraction, enabling more sophisticated question-answering systems, and providing a scalable method for building knowledge bases directly from large text corpora.
