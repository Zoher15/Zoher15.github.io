The **Text2Graph** project represents a collaborative effort to advance foundational AI systems through breakthrough knowledge extraction technologies. This large-scale research initiative focused on designing and building production-ready systems to extract structured graph representations from unstructured text at scale.

This collaborative research drives scientific advancement in knowledge-grounded reasoning for next-generation Large Language Models. The work enables breakthrough capabilities in information extraction, powers sophisticated question-answering systems, and provides scalable methodologies for building comprehensive knowledge bases from massive text corpora. The project demonstrates how foundational research can solve real-world challenges at the scale needed to impact billions of users.
