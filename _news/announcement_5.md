My virtual NAACL24 presentation for `Rematch` is now live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQMfbLQhz4I)!

In this video, I delve into:
🔍 The significance of graphical representations in language, or "local knowledge graphs."
⚖️ The critical aspects we aim to optimize while keeping computational costs low.
🏆 How our algorithm, REMATCH, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in these areas.
